## About the game

### Objective

Reach 15 likes without going bankrupt.

Be careful with the mood of the clients. Several things can happen:
- If they are ordered food being happy, they will pay and leave a LIKE!
- If they are ordered food being neutral or annoyed, they will only pay.
- If they get angry, they will leave the diner and leave a DISLIKE!

Also, be careful with the number of likes, since it affects the amount of clients that go to the diner.
The higher it gets, the more clients will come.

### Player interactions

1. Buy ingredients by clicking on the Shopping Cart icon (bottom right of the screen).
 
There are 3 types of ingredients to cook 3 types of meals. Each of them has a different effect:
- Hamburguer with chips: it has no special effects.
- Nuggets: faster to cook.
- Cake: it makes clients instantly happy.

Each type of meal can only be cooked by a cook specialised in its type in a specialised cooker, but can be served by any waitress.

The ingredients bought and the meals cooked appear in a menu on the bottom of the screen. E.g.: cake 1/10: you have cooked 1 cake and you have 10 ingredients to cook 10 more cakes.

2. Buy more workers by clicking on the cash register box or on the cooker box.
 
- If the box corresponds to a cash register, you will buy a new waitress.
- If the box corresponds to a cooker, you will buy a new cook. There are 3 types of cookers (hamburguers, nuggets and cakes), corresponding to the 3 types of meals.

At the start of the game, the diner has only 2 workers, a waitress and a cook. This cook is specialised in cooking Hamburguer with chips.

3. Buy more sits by clicking on the table or stool box.

If the diner increases its sits, more clients can come.

4. When a client is sat, order food for them by clicking on them. A menu with the different types of meals will appear (top left of the screen).

You can only order meals that you have cooked.
