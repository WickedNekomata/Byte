# BYTE

Byte is a management demo-game developed by <b>Sandra Alvarez</b> and <b>Guillem Costa</b> for the AI subject under the supervision of the lecturer <b>Ricard Pillosu</b>. The game uses our <b>own steering behaviours</b> (using [Recast](https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation) to generate the path) and [Node Canvas](http://nodecanvas.paradoxnotion.com/) for the <b>behaviour trees</b>.
 
In Byte, you take the role of the manager of a burger fast food restaurant.
Will you be able to bring the success to your new business or will you throw in the towel? Play with the likes!

For a detailed description about the game as well as of the behaviour trees being used, please check our repository:
